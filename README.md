## About this project

I want to combine all of the Spotify related work I have done into one single web app.

User will have to connect their Spotify account OR upload their data to get started.

### **1. User Profile & Preferences:**

- Display the user's Spotify username and the platform used most often.
- Show a map of countries where the user has streamed content.
- Preferences like shuffle mode, offline mode, and private sessions.

### **2. Listening Habits:**

- A calendar heatmap to show the streaming activities on specific dates.
- Average listening time per day or week.
- The most common reason for starting and ending tracks (e.g., manual selection, track finished).

### **3. Favorite Content:**

- Top songs, artists, and albums.
- Favorite podcasts, including episodes and shows.
- A clickable list of tracks and episodes with Spotify URIs to play them directly.

### **4. Trend Analysis:**

- Trend of genres over time.
- Usage pattern over different devices or browsers.
- How often the user skips tracks and in what context (e.g., playlist, artist's radio).
